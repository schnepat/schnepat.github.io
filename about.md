# About Me

I'm an Applied Computer Science graduate student at **Grand Valley State University** (expected 2026), focusing on **Cloud Engineering, Data Analytics, and Automation**.

I currently work at **Schreiber Foods**, leading automation and quality data projects â€” including a **real-time packaging defect detection system** using NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and YOLOv8.

My research interests include:
- Cloud-native AI (GCP, Vertex AI)
- Industrial analytics (OEE, predictive quality)
- Quantum networking and secure communications
